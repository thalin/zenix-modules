# NixOS Roles

Roles are collections of enabled modules that define a specific function of a system. For example, the `gui-desktop` role enables a graphical user interface, while the `server` role enables services like OpenSSH. Roles can be combined to create a complete system configuration.

[Suites](../suites/README.md) are collections of roles that define a complete system type, such as a workstation or a server.
