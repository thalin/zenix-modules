# Home-Manager Roles

Roles are collections of enabled modules that define a specific function of a user environment. For example, the `cli` role enables a command-line interface with tools like `zsh`, `nixvim`, and `tmux`.

[Suites](../suites/README.md) are collections of roles that define a complete user environment type, such as a workstation.
