# Zen Nix Modules

Common modules to make it easier to support multiple NixOS host repos for different purposes. As much configuration as possible is stored here so I can just import it in other repos.

Uses [snowfall-lib](https://snowfall.org/guides/lib/quickstart/) for easy file structuring and reduced boilerplate.
